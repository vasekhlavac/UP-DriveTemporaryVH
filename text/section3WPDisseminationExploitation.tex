\headerBox{Objectives}{}

The objectives of this work package are
 \begin{denseItemize}
 \item to transfer knowledge both within the consortium and to the outside world.
 \item to set up and maintain a comprehensive set of dissemination tools and mechanisms.
 \item to promote the results developed within the project.
\end{denseItemize}

All \WPInnovation{} tasks are support tasks for other work packages and tasks. Provision of the content itself will be part of the technical tasks within the related work packages. Further information on the \Project{} approach to Innovation Related Activities can be found in Section~\ref{sec:impact}.

\begin{tasks}{\WPInnovationNo}

\item {\bf Management of knowledge}
\label{task:wpinnovation:knowledge}
\taskpartners{\PRAGUE}{\ETHZ}

The key-objective of this task is knowledge management both within the consortium and to the outside world.  This includes four main activities: First, an
{\bf internal project web-site} (in addition to the public one) which will serve as an internal communication portal on the web for the members of the consortium.  It will provide a means of communication between partners providing access to working documents, management resources and restricted information within the project.  It also provides a storage space for project material such as a git repository. Second, a {\bf who is who} list of persons
involved in the \Project{} project including ongoing M.Sc.~and Ph.D.~projects as well as lab descriptions. This is especially helpful for students in the \Project{} project.  Third, this task ensures that {\bf IPRs} are properly handled and patents are filed where and when necessary. If required, the necessary legal advice on the proper procedure will be provided within this task. And finally, this includes {\em data management}, which ensures that the data produced by the project is available for further research  -- while respecting the data policies of the consortium members.

\item {\bf Dissemination}
\label{task:wpinnovation:dissemination}
\taskpartners{\VW, \IBM}{ all other partners}

\WPInnovation{} ensures proper dissemination of the \Project{} results which are continuously carried out during the \Project{} project. This task organizes the transfer of knowledge to the outside world and also within the consortium. It will ensure that all involved partners are kept informed and will promote awareness of project results in the general, business and scientific community at large. This could be in the form of documents, brochures, Web-publications, workshops, articles, papers for journals and conferences or other publicity work. Key elements are:
\begin{denseItemize}
\item Public Project Web-site: A fully functional project web site will be available as soon as project month 2. The web site will offer detailed information about the project and its goals as well as provide continuously updated access to documentation, scientific reports and project-related papers.

%\item A newsletter that will be sent to interested individuals and companies.

\item General Dissemination: Initially the dissemination to the general public will be promoted by the creation of a brochure, as well as a video/animation trailer showing the capabilities of the technology and used cases developed within \Project{}. At the end of the project a public final presentation will be performed. It will showcase the technological capabilities of the system as well as the benefits for the individual users and the society. As preparation for the final presentation, \Project{} will perform also an internal mid-term presentation after the first integration cycle.

\item Academic Dissemination: All university partners in the project will promote \Project{} developments by publishing scientific results to technical journals, conferences, workshops. The list of target conferences can be found on page~\pageref{sec:diss}.

\item Industrial Dissemination: Industrial dissemination will be promoted by the industrial partners. The modules and technologies developed within \Project{} may form the basis for future commercialization.
\end{denseItemize}

A detailed description of the dissemination activities can be found the Section~\ref{sec:impact}.

\item {\bf Exploitation}
\label{task:wpinnovation:exploitation}
\taskpartner{\IBM, \VW},{ all other partners}

This task ensures proper exploitation of the \Project{} results. During the \Project{} project, we will continuously pursue exploitation activities. This includes activities such as
\begin{denseItemize}
\item An address database for \Project{} related stakeholders, potential customers, interested individuals and companies.
\item The identification of exploitable results as well as the development of a project policy regarding the exploitation of project results will lie in the responsibility of this task. Exploitation will be employed to the greatest possible advantage for all members given the principles established in the consortium agreement.
\end{denseItemize}
A detailed description of the exploitation activities can be found in Section~\ref{sec:impact}.
