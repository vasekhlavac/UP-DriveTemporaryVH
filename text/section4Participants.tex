Volkswagen operates 118 production facilities in 31 countries and has a broad product range stretching from ecological passenger cars to luxury and sports cars, light \& heavy duty trucks and commercial vehicles. In 2014, Volkswagen employed nearly 593,000 people across the group and delivered 10,137 million vehicles (12.9\% of the world market) to customers. Annual turnover exceeded \euro{}202 billion with expenditures for R\&D of \euro{}11.5 billion. 45,742 employees within R\&D account for about 7.7\% of the total workforce. Volkswagen has extensive experience in the co-ordination of and participation in national and EC funded projects and networks involving European car manufacturers, suppliers, research organisations and universities.

Volkswagen Group Research has been very active in the fields of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Automated Driving for at least last decade. It has taken part in or lead numerous EC funded projects in the field, including: V-Charge, AdaptIVe, interactIVe, ARTRAC, HAVEit, euroFOT, INTERSAFE-2. This, as well as high internal investment into research activities has lead to extensive experience in such key areas as perception, scene interpretation, decision making, navigation, motion planning and - last but not least - vehicle setup and system integration.
