\subsubsection{Budget Allocation in Brief}
Form A3 presents the resources needed for \Project. In more detail Section~\ref{sec:resources} (Resources) presents the complete costs of the project, encompassing personnel costs, management costs and other costs (including travel costs, consumables, etc.) and the requested financing. The major part of the resources covers personnel and overhead costs which are needed to bring the necessary expertise into the project. Furthermore, budget is allocated for equipment/consumables for the partners. The allocated components differ among the individual partners, as replicating a full car at all partners' sites would be too expensive and is also not needed to conduct the project. Two automated vehicle platforms and a cloud infrastructure will be needed within \Project{}. One vehicle will be located at \VW{} at all times, while the other one will be shared among the other partners. The project intends on re-using one of the cars from the V-Charge project and for that one \VW{} only requests funding for extensions and modifications. \IBM requests equipment funding for the cloud infrastructure that will be required for the computation, maintenance and deployment of the lifelong map as well as offline learning for scene understanding. While both the vehicles as well as the cloud appear on the budget of individual partners, these platforms truly enable the project and serve the entire consortium. Travel expenses have been planned to ensure proper interaction with all partners, particularly during the four consortium wide integration weeks, and the dissemination and clustering activities.

Table~\ref{tab:wpstaffwp} on Page~\pageref{tab:wpstaffwp} shows the staff effort on a per partner level broken down into work packages needed to carry out this project. The total budget necessary for carrying out the project is \euro 7,604,894 out of which \euro 4,671,896 is funding requested from the commission.  The contribution for \ETHZ{} (\euro 1,211,958) and \IBM{} (\euro 1,721,040) will be provided by Switzerland so that no EC contribution is needed for these partners. The budget is calculated in conformity with the accounting system of the partners, according to the financial conditions of H2020. A detailed overview of the budget is given in Figure~\ref{fig:budgetoverview} on Page~\pageref{fig:budgetoverview}.
