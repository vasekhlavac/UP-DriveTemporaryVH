\subsubsection{Deliverables}
The deliverables are intended to support internal communication, decision making, and to document the progress. However, we also intend to publish the majority of the deliverables -- particularly those marked as reports -- as scientific papers in journals and at highly ranked conferences or alternatively as an open-source release of the corresponding software component. The list of deliverables is provided in Table~\ref{tab:deliverables} on Page~\pageref{tab:deliverables}.
