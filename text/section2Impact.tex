The \Project{} project reaches for significant impact as set out in the Horizon 2020 work programme and Strategic Research Agenda established by the euRobotics AISBL by focusing on the described two-pronged strategy of targeting specific high-value market domains in urban low-speed automated transportation, and in tandem maturing associated base technologies towards higher technology readiness levels.

All research conducted in the project is hence application driven and technological advances will be rigorously validated in experiments. The combination of leading-edge research and demonstration in both closed and public urban environments will bring the developed technologies out the research labs and closer to commercialization.

%The key developments and research actions performed within \Project{} will lead to the major building blocks depicted in Figure~\ref{TODO} on page~\ref{TODO}.
