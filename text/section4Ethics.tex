\section{Ethics and Security}
% This section is not covered by the page limit.

\subsection{Ethics}
% If you have entered any ethics issues in the ethical issue table in
% the administrative proposal forms, you must:
% - submit an ethics self-assessment, which:
%   * describes how the proposal meets the national legal and ethical
%     requirements of the country or countries where the tasks raising
%     ethical issues are to be carried out; 
%   * explains in detail how you intend to address the issues in the
%     ethical issues table, in particular as regards:
%     + research objectives (e.g. study of vulnerable populations, dual
%       use, etc.)
%     + research methodology (e.g. clinical trials, involvement of
%       children and related consent procedures, protection of any data
%       collected, etc.) 
%     + the potential impact of the research (e.g. dual use issues,
%       environmental damage, stigmatisation of particular social groups,
%       political or financial retaliation, benefit-sharing,  malevolent
%       use , etc.).
% - provide the documents that you need under national law(if you
%   already have them), e.g.:
%   * an ethics committee opinion;
%   * the document notifying activities raising ethical issues or
%     authorising such activities
%   
%   If these documents are not in English, you must also submit an
%   English summary of them (containing, if available, the conclusions
%   of the committee or authority concerned).
%   
%   If you plan to request these documents specifically for the project
%   you are proposing, your request must contain an explicit reference
%   to the project title.

The \Project{} project does not raise any ethical issues with regard to the ethical issues table as mentioned in the administrative proposal forms.
